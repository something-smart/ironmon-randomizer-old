| Question | Answer (my best guess if not official) |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Can you pick up items that are not randomized? (e.g. wednesday full restore in lake of rage) | I don't think so
| Can you pick up items that are only available on certain days (HGSS), or certain months (BW/BW2)? | Days no, months maybe? I don't know if there's a consensus for gen 5
| Can you change the game's clock after the run has started? | I think no
| Can you set your emulator to a particular date and time for an in-game advantage (e.g. no hail on Red)? | I think yes?
| If your starter is banned, can you choose between the other 2 options? | Yes
| If you are unable to fight all trainers in a gym (e.g. HM friend in bugsy's gym dies to whirlwindÂ + pursuit before the double), can you leave to PC heal it? | I've never seen this come up, I think yes
| Can you PC heal in general (not in dungeons obviously)? | Yes
| Is the underground tunnel in Goldenrod a dungeon? | I think so
| Is Pinwheel Forest interior a dungeon? | No, but maybe it should be
| Are you allowed to have HM friends with you at any time you choose? | I think so
| Can you evolve HM friends? | I think so
| Are you allowed to have an HM friend when you don't need one with the ability Illusion? Can you choose an HM friend tactically for Illusion? | I think it's yes to all
| Are you allowed to have an HM friend, that you don't intend to use in battle, with an ability that activates upon being sent out like Intimidate? If so, what do you do if it gets roared in? | I think it's no to the first question
| In a double battle, if you cannot stall a turn (no balls in gen 3-4, no useless heals in gen 5+), are you allowed to use a stat-boosting move with your HM friend? Are you allowed to attack your main pokemon? What if attacking your main pokemon gives you an advantage (e.g. Justified)? | I assume you can use a stat boosting move or attack your main, but not for benefit
| My understanding is that you can pivot to gift mons after you see the species, but nothing else. Is that accurate? | I assume so, I've almost never seen this
| Can you pivot to pokemon evolved from gift eggs? | I assume so, I've never seen this
| Can you use banned moves if you cannot use any other move? What if you have PP on other moves but cannot use them (due to disable, taunt, etc)? | Zac said yes to the first. Unsure on the second but probably yes?
| Can you use banned moves if they are called by some legal move, such as Copycat? What if you know for a fact Copycat will copy a banned move (because you are faster)? What if you don't know (because you are slower), but you know it's possible? | I would guess yes to all?
| Are banned moves usable before the rival(s) fight? | I think no
| Are banned moves usable in all three of Cheren, Bianca, and N fights in BW? | Yes
| Is any fight considered the "lab fight" in DP? | I think no
| If you pivot to a pokemon with a banned ability, can you pivot again on the same route? Can you catch another pokemon of the same species to see if it has a different ability? If no, what if there are no pivot locations left? | People used to do this a while ago, but I think no?
| Catch and release is allowed when you can't run. Is catch and release always allowed (gen 5 and earlier)? | Yes (I think), just don't look at the stats
| If you are temporarily trapped and don't have balls, can you kill the pokemon? | I think so?
| If you are permanently trapped and attempt to catch it and fail and run out of balls, can you kill the pokemon? | Probably yes
| If a wild pokemon has a self-fainting move, what steps are you required to take to avoid gaining experience from it? Must you avoid that grass if you're able to? | I think you have to avoid it if you're slower, and always run from that mon if you see it
| If a wild pokemon has a self-fainting move, and it faints itself again after it's already done it once, are you forced to pivot? | I think yes
| If you run out of balls after being forced to pivot, can you leave the route (without healing) to buy balls? Can you buy balls of any type? What if the route is a dungeon? | I think yes to all
| Can you use a forced heal in a dungeon immediately before leaving it? (I know you can't get the item in Pokemon Tower. Another example is fighting the Doctor last in the sewers in BW2) | No
| Can you use the white/black flutes? (They increase/decrease encounter rate) | Yes
| Can you kill static pokemon you can catch, but can't run from (e.g. electrodes in rocket hideout)? | Yes
