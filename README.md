This project is a modified version of the [Pok√©mon Randomizer](https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-Pokemon-randomizer-zx/releases), by Dabomstew and Ajarmar.

It adds some settings to the randomizer that are intended to be particularly useful to those playing the [Ironmon Challenge](ironmon.gg). These features range from minor quality-of-life improvements to removing significant obstacles that can impact the game.

You are free to use this for whatever you want. However, if you're playing Ironmon, make sure to disclose somewhere which of these tweaks you are doing.

This repo also contains a ruleset called Meteor Kaizo that I (something_smart) am developing, with the intent to show off some of the new changes and make a slightly easier and more exciting Kaizo experience.

I have no opposition to uploading the code, I am just lazy. I will do it at some point. Feel free to bother me on Discord (Something_Smart#8109) for that, or for any issues or feature requests.
